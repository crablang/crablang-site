      <h1>The Official Home of CrabLang!</h1>
      <p>
        A community fork of a language named after a plant fungus. All of the
        memory-safe features you love, now with 100% less bureaucracy!
      </p>
      <h2>Why CrabLang?</h2>
      <p>
        The Crab (or “CrabLang”) community fork was created as a lighthearted
        yet measured response to the growing concerns within the community about
        the influence of corporations, restrictive trademark policy proposed by
        the foundation, and internal political decisions. This was not a
        “knee-jerk” reaction, nor was it an attempt to spread fear or cause
        panic. While the document the foundation drafted did lead to the fork,
        we believe it is an overdue solution to a problem that already existed,
        and addresses some issues that many community members have had for some
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        First and foremost: CrabLang is not trying to replace our beloved
        language. If you are happy with the way things are, we encourage you to
        continue using your language of choice. Our goal is not to fracture the
        community, but rather to provide an alternative for those who share our
        concerns and wish to have more freedom in using, creating with, and
        promoting the language without worrying about the litigation associated
        with trademark infringement or being affected by questionable leadership
        decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We acknowledge and appreciate the hard work and financial support that
        corporations have provided to the original project. We understand the
        importance of their contributions, but we also believe that it is
        essential to maintain a balance between corporate influence and the will
        of the community. The CrabLang Collective aims to provide a space where
        the community can thrive without the constraints imposed by corporate
        interests and opaque leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to emphasize that we are not at odds with the project or the
        original language. We appreciate everything they do to make the language
        better, and our fork’s main branch will continue to stay up to date with
        the upstream codebase. Our main goal is to ensure that the community has
        an alternative that aligns with their values and desire for unrestricted
        use, transparency, and fair treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crab community fork is driven by our love for a language named after
        a type of fungus. We simply want to use it while retaining the ability
        to create content and promote its name, logo, and other assets however
        we please, without the limitations imposed by a trademark policy or
        questionable leadership decisions. By offering a community-driven
        alternative, we hope to maintain a spirit of collaboration, innovation,
        and creative freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our shared passion for programming, we welcome anyone interested to
        join us in exploring the Crab community fork. Whether or not you fully
        agree with our concerns, we believe that diversity of thought and a
        commitment to inclusivity will only strengthen our collective efforts.
